***I did not make this***.
*This code comes from a decompiled extension I found in an online archive, since the original source appears to be down permanently.*

*Original extension is in the dist folder. Should work with Firefox 3.6 but don't take my word for it. For a Greasemonkey version that works with modern Firefox, see [urbandead-userscripts](https://github.com/tassaron/urbandead-userscripts).*
